# go-xrate

go-xrate is a small lib for getting cryptocurrency rates from several Exchanges around the world.

## Install

To install, just run 

`go get github.com/swipecoin/go-xrate`

It doesn't rely on any external lib :D
  
## Supported Exchanges

As of now, only a few exchanges from Brazil and Binance are supported. But the code is prepared to work with multiple countries, fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. 

Here's the supported list (We are constantly adding more and more):
- [FoxBit](https://foxbit.exchange)
- [Mercado Bitcoin](https://mercadobitcoin.com.br) 
- [BitcoinTrade](https://bitcointrade.com.br)
- [Bitcoin To You](https://bitcointoyou.com)
- [Binance](https://binance.com)

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

- BTC: Bitcoin

## Usage
It's really simple to get started.

##### First, you import the package:
```go
// Here we are importing from the brazilian package of exchanges
import (
    xrbr "go-xrate/exchanges/br"
)
```

##### Then, instantiate a new ExchangeCrawler and call the specific method for the cryptocurrency you want:
```go
// FoxBit - Bitcoin
xrbr.NewFoxBitCrawler().BTC()
  
// OR 
// Mercado Bitcoin - Bitcoin Cash
xrbr.NewMercadoBitcoinCrawler().BCH()
 
// OR 
// Mercado Bitcoin - Litecoin
xrbr.NewMercadoBitcoinCrawler().LTC()
 
// OR 
// BitcoinTrade - Bitcoin
xrbr.NewBitcoinTradeCrawler().BTC()
 
// OR 
// Bitcoin To You - Bitcoin
xrbr.NewBitcoinToYouCrawler().BTC()
```
